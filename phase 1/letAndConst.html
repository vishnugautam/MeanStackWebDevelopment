<!--The differences between let and var are:
1. var is global scope so it is applicable everywhere so if you declare var in a scope it takes the new value, let is block scope so when you declare it in a block, it wont take its value.
2. var can be redeclared whereas let cannot be redeclared.
3. var can be initialised before declaration but let cannot be initialised.
